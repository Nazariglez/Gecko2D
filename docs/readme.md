Gecko2D is a flexible and powerful cross-platform game framework that will allow you to create games easily and deploy it
to browsers, mobile devices, desktop, and even consoles.

Under the hood, Gecko2D is an [Entity-Component-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) framework built on top of [Haxe](http://haxe.org) and [Kha](http://kha.tech) which allow the best performance and real cross-platform
compilation, using Javascript and WebGL when compile to browsers, and C++ when compile to mobile using metal or opengl, to desktop using opengl, directx or vulkan, and consoles with their own drivers.

This framework aims to be a solid foundation for all your games, allowing you to port your games to others platforms using the same source code, saving time and money.
