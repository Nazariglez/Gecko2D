# Guide
To use __Gecko2D__ you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 9.x.x or higher.


## Installation
Just install it via npm:
```
npm install gecko2d -g
```

You can test it typing in your terminal `gecko init -t flappy watch` and going to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to play a flappy bird clone.

## Getting Started

### Initialize
You can start a new project typing in your terminal `gecko init` on an empty folder or `gecko init -t empty`, this will clone the structure from the [template basic or empty](https://github.com/Nazariglez/Gecko2D/tree/master/templates), and create the config file `dev.gecko.toml`.

### Project structure
Every project has this structure by default:
- __Assets:__ A directory to add the game images, sounds, etc...
- __Libraries:__ Plugins goes here.
- __Sources:__ Where the magic happends, the source code of your game.
- __dev.gecko.toml:__ This is the project's config file, read more on [his section](#config-file).
- __khafile.js:__ Kha's config, this file is autogenerated and (normally) you don't need to change it.

### Build and serve
To build the game use `gecko build`. By default the build command will create a html5 bundle, you can serve it on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) using `gecko serve`. To build and serve automatically when some source change use `gecko watch`.

## Command Line Interface
Gecko has a command line interface to make your life easy. 

- __gecko init [ -t template ]:__ initialize a new project.
- __gecko build [ target ] [ -c config ]:__ compile the current project.
